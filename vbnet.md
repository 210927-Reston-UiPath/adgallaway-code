# Encapsulation in .Net

- Solutions that make up an ajpplication
    - group of projects that work together
    - can be heterogeneuos 
        - you can have a project written in vb, another written in c# (must be .Net compliant)
    - usually characterized as your .sln files
        - this .sln file enumerates the projects that are part of the solution
    - Projects group together namespaces, classes, and other types
    - Classes group together data and logic that go together
- Do note that encapsulation is about wrapping data and logic that go together in one unit
    - This is accomplished by: data wrapping (encaps via packaging) and data hiding (access mods)
